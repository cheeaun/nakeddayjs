This is a copy or a fork of [Marat](http://www.dyatko.ru/)'s nakedDay.js. It's a script to celebrate the [CSS Naked Day](http://naked.dustindiaz.com/).

Usage

Just include either one of the JS files, depending on which JS framework is used or not used. For example:

	<script src="nakedday.js"></script>
	
That's all. :)
